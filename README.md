## Functionality

Users are presented with the top trending daily stocks from r/WallStreetBets, according to mentions. Users can see how many times these stocks have been mentioned, and how their position among the Trending Leaderboard has changed over the past day.

Users can click on a stock ticker from the r/WallStreetBets trending stock list, or input a stock ticker of their choosing and click 'Search' button to find the five most salient facts about a certain stock.

After searching, or clicking from the list, users will see that stock added to their list of 10 most recently searched stocks.
